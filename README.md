This contains all the files that I have submitted for the course Intro to Game Design Lab

This project was programmed using the pygame from Python language. The reason why was because to understand the game concepts from the very scratch provides us a better understanding on how game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine 4/5 works. This would give the developer the basic logic for game and would have easier transition on the use of game engines.


**This was programmed during my 3rd year in college BSCS major in Game Development.
