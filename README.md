This contains all the files that I have submitted for the course Intro to Game Design Lab

The game was entitled "FARM INVADERS" which is a survival wave type of game which involves keyboard and mouse buttons to be played.

This project was programmed using the pygame from Python language. The reason why was because to understand the game concepts from the very scratch provides us a better understanding on how game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine 4/5 works. This would give the developer the basic logic for game and would have easier transition on the use of game engines.

*The file progression is based on OE the higher version would give you the improved version of the game.

**This was programmed during my 3rd year in college BSCS major in Game Development.
